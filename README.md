# Hemisphere_tracker
  Hemisphere Tracker is a React-based web application that allows users to track the position of the sun in different hemispheres. It provides real-time information about the sun's azimuth and elevation angles for any given location on Earth.
  This project was developed as part of a learning exercise to explore the capabilities of React and demonstrate the integration of various APIs to fetch and display data. It can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications that require real-time sun position tracking.
  
## Features
Real-time tracking of the sun's position in different hemispheres.
User-friendly interface with interactive map-based controls.
Displays the sun's azimuth and elevation angles for a selected location.
Adjustable date and time settings to view the sun's position at different moments.
Supports both Northern and Southern hemispheres.
